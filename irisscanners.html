			<h2>Iris and Retina Scanners</h2>
			
		<p> Iris scanners can be hacked; retina scanners are harder to hack. </p>
			
			<p> First of all, let us think about all the millions of pictures out there of everyone in the world. Then think about photo technology and how it is getting more advanced by higher resolution of photos. Also think about high quality printers. With these three advances in mind, it is easier to hack iris scanners.</p>
			
			<p> All you have to do is take a photo of someone, this can be up to fifteen feet away from their face. You want to take a picture using a night mode or remove a cameras infrared settings to print out a high resolution colored photo of someoneâ€™s eye. Now you have a printed photo of the eye that is real size, glue a contact lense over their eye to give it some depth and now you will be able to get into anyones phone you want.</p>
			
			<p>Having a retina scanner makes it harder to be hacked. One disadvantage of retina scanners, is that it can be hard to get an image in the first place. Since the scanners see the deep veins within the eyes, it can be painful to acquire an image.  Your eyes undergo a bright flash of light and you have to try to keep your eyes open. The retina scanner is looking for a really clear picture of your retina, and it may take a few tries to achieve such a clear image. This would be easy to achieve such a photo from anyone in the world, especially famous people. </p>
