			<h2>Fingerprints</h2>
			
			<p>Having a fingerprint as your password does not make it impossible to hack into your account, it just makes it a lot harder. 
			Once a hacker has your fingerprint, you can’t change it like your password. The potential harm is bigger since the hacker can then access everything you secured with your fingerprint  </p>

			<p>People have put a copy of the fingerprint on a latex glove and used this, made a 3D print of the finger, used special ink on a paper,...  </p>

			<p>The question is, How do they get the fingerprints in the first place? A german hacker has used high quality pictures of a politician where her finger was show. He then used this as a base to replicate the fingerprint and actually got access to the politician’s phone. </p>

			<p>Another hacker has sampled fingerprints from beer bottles and used those to break into phones.  </p>

			<p>Researchers from the university of New York made a system that fooled machines about 65% of the time. They made fake fingerprints, “MasterPrints”, by using common patterns found on fingerprints. </p>

			<p>Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but on phones, the scanners are so small that they only read partial fingerprints. This is why the MasterPrints work
			The phone typically takes eight to ten pictures of a print to make it easier to match. 
			It's like if you had 30 passwords and a hacker only needed one of them to break into your account. </p>
