			<h1>The Weaknesses of Biometric Security</h1> <!-- Come up with better title -->
		</header>
		<article>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Biometrics are often touted as the wave of the future in security, but there are some inherent defects in biometric security systems that need to be addressed. Imagine using a fingerprint ID for security, only to find that some hacker has duplicated your print and hacked into your account. If this were to happen with a password, you would simply change the password. But when this happens with biometrics… are you supposed to change your fingerprint? Furthermore, biometric data is actually much less secure than a password, seeing as your face, fingerprints, and irises are all often out in public, whereas a password is generally never public.</p>
			<p>Hackers have a variety of tools in order to fool facial, fingerprint, and iris recognition security measures. <!-- add some more here --></p>
			<h2>Facial Recognition</h2>
			<p>	
				When it comes to facial recognition, like any biometric security measure the security of the device will 
				vary with the quality of the implementation. Facial recognition although sometimes considered as the 
				most secure in some cases, can sometimes be the easiest to trick. Depending on the technology behind 
				the facial recognition you’re using it could be as easy as showing a picture of your potential victim, 
				but also might be as difficult as having to make a high quality 3D model of someones head and face to be 
				trick the facial recognition sensor. 
			</p>

			<p>	
				The main technology that you have to take into account is if the facial recognition takes 3 dimensional input 
				or if it just uses 2d data to use its facial recognition. While just using data from a tradition photo 
				sensor can be much faster, by using less processing power, it has been proven that these can be tricked 
				as simply as by only using a printed photo. Technology like Apple’s FaceID on the other hand, actually 
				uses an Infrared dot plaster and an Infrared camera to read the distances of the 3D dots plotted across 
				your face and can tell if it is looking at a 3D or 2D plane which gives it the ability to make a 3D model 
				of your face and learn the 3D features of your face.

			<h2>Fingerprints</h2>

			<p>
				
			Having a fingerprint as your password does not make it impossible to hack into your account, it just makes it a lot harder. 
			Once a hacker has your fingerprint, you can’t change it like your password. The potential harm is bigger since the hacker can then access everything you secured with your fingerprint  
			
			</p>

			<p>
			
			People have put a copy of the fingerprint on a latex glove and used this, made a 3D print of the finger, used special ink on a paper,...  
			
			</p>

			<p>
				
			The question is, How do they get the fingerprints in the first place? A german hacker has used high quality pictures of a politician where her finger was show. He then used this as a base to replicate the fingerprint and actually got access to the politician’s phone. 
		
			</p>

			<p>
			
			Another hacker has sampled fingerprints from beer bottles and used those to break into phones.  
			
			</p>

			<p>
			
			Researchers from the university of New York made a system that fooled machines about 65% of the time. They made fake fingerprints, “MasterPrints”, by using common patterns found on fingerprints. 
			
			</p>

			<p>
				
			Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but on phones, the scanners are so small that they only read partial fingerprints. This is why the MasterPrints work
			The phone typically takes eight to ten pictures of a print to make it easier to match. 
			It's like if you had 30 passwords and a hacker only needed one of them to break into your account.
